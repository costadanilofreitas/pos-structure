# Configuring the python interpreter

Create a file python_path.bat in the root folder and add the following lines to it:

```
set PYTHON_DIR=${PYTHON_DIR}
set PATH=%PYTHON_DIR%;%PYTHON_DIR%\Scripts;%PATH%
```
Replace ${PYTHON_DIR} to the directory where python is installed on your system.


# Installing the dependencies

The runtime dependencies can be installed running `install_lib.bat`\
\
Development dependencies can be installed running `install_dev_lib.bat`\

# Creating the deployment directory

Running `publish.bat` will create the dist directory. The contents of this directory can be published

# PyCodeStyle

Before committing, run `pycodestyle.bat` and fix all reported errors.\
\
If there is a good explanation, some errors can be ignored

# Running the unit tests

The unit tests can be run using the `test\testenv\run_all_unit_tests.bat`\
Only the tests in the `test` folder are run.\
Integration tests must be placed in folders inside the `test` so that they are not run when running all the unit tests.

# Coverage report

The coverage report is generated by running the `test\testenv\coverage_report.bat`\
Three reports are generated:\
1. The console report is printed on the screen
2. The XML report is created in the `test\testenv\reports`
3. The HTML report is created in the `test\testenv\htmlcov`
